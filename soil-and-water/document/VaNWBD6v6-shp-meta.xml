			<abstract>These are the latest (Version 6) national hydrologic unit (HU) boundaries at levels 1-6 for Virginia.  They have been created in compliance with the 
most recent published federal standards for delineation of hydrologic units and contain national WBD HU model changes made since that time up to the publication date.  
The Virginia NWBD schemas include variations from the national WBD schemas. This dataset covers the whole state and is seamless with the WBD products of surrounding 
states at the time of publication.</abstract>
			<purpose>Developed as part of a seamless hydrologic unit product for the nation at the sixth level. To be used for more detailed watershed planning work in the state. 
This becomes the official statewide sixth level hydrologic unit delineation for Virginia.</purpose>

			<update>Changes to the linework detail are made whenever reason can be shown to do so. These changes are usually so minor as to only be visible at a very large scale 
display, and do not constitute a significant variance from the original form of this version.  Should any significant linework errors or any further significant attribution 
errors be found after July 2019 they will be logged for revision in a seventh version.</update>

		<attracc>
			<attraccr>The assigning of all attributes in this dataset to the arcs and polygons of the sixth level hydrologic units has been done by the state
personnel with the authority and resources to do so.  Their work is reviewed by interested agencies of the Commonwealth and Federal government.
Any miscoded attribution is corrected upon discovery.  Attribution that is currently correct can become incorrect due to changes made in the Watershed Boundary 
Datast (WBD) units of bordering states.  This is especially true of HUC12 codes because there are no gaps in the sequential sixth order numbering. It is also true
of HUC12 names, as there cannot be duplicate names within a HUC8 unit no matter if the name is not duplcated within any one state.
The unit coding rule to have units only flow into other units with higher unit codes (i.e. 0507020102 cannot flow into 0507020101) could not be
strictly enforced at all orders.  It was not strictly followed in the original coding of units for the first through fourth orders in the 1970s
(i.e. 03010105 flows into 03010104, and fourth order units of 020801 flow into 02080101).  Unit codes up to the fourth order were considered established
and not open to recoding as part of the VaNWBD development except for rare cases where mistakes had been made and all federal and state parties were agreeable
to recoding.  The higher order flow direction of coding was originally adhered to for all fifth and sixth order units within all fourth order units until such time
that the USGS decided that the presence of the downstream code in the polygon attribute table was suffcient for knowing flow paths.  Due to updates the
state VAHU6 text codes for units have several instances of higher codes flowing into lower codes and not matching the order of HUC12 codes.  This occurs
where HUC12 codes were altered after several years of HU layer use.  VAHU6 geocoding to many datasets precluded simply switching these codes after version 4.
Reported downstream unit codes for sixth order units that, at their confluence, join to flow across a fifth order unit boundary disagree by design between
the actual unit boundary alignment regarding flow between fifth level units.  As an example, if units A and B join to flow into C, and units A-C are all in
the same fifth order unit, units A and B will both have a downstream unit code of C.  For the VaNWBD this will be true even if unit C is in different fifth
level unit.</attraccr>
		</attracc>
		<logic>All arcs are used to define hydrologic unit boundaries or the Virginia state boundary.  There are no dangling arcs. Boundaries at all orders are seamless 
across the boundaries of the adjoining states. Fifth order units may be constructed by aggregating sixth order units on the first 10 digits of HUC12.</logic>
		<complete>This version of the NWBD for Virginia is considered complete.  However there are a number of reasons to anticipate an eventual update to Version 7:
1> Further use of the layer may find needed corrections in line or attribution;
2> Continued modifications to the WBD in other states may affect the VaNWBD linework or unit codes;
3> WBD standards continue to evolve and can affect the VaNWBD;
4> Greater linework accuracy will be possible when Lidar efforts in the Commonwealth are complete;
5> Integration of the WBD with high resolution NHD will likely require WBD modifications.

				<horizpar>Hydrologic unit boundary locations as captured from the DRGs will degrade in accuracy where topography is flat and contours more 
widely dispersed from one another, since contours are the basis for positioning hydrologic unit boundaries.  Accuracy will be most compromised
along the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Ocean shorelines, particularly on barrier islands, due to the speed of geomorphological change in these areas.</horizpar>
				<qhorizpa>
					<horizpav>14.342</horizpav>
					<horizpae>Calculated as the offset in meters from true ground location due to the National Map Accuracy Standards of the DRG source maps plus the
resolution of the capture of coordinates from this source at display scale plus the maximum movement possible due to processing tolerances applied. 
Therefore the value represents the worst accuracy expected under normal data capture and processing procedures.</horizpae>

				<procdesc>The initial hydrologic units of Virginia layer was digitized by the ISSL at Virginia Tech off of the USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle maps.
Delineations within the existing Catalog Units of HUmap_1974 were made by the VA DCR and the USDA Soil Conservation Service (SCS).  The line and attribute data 
were delivered to the VA DCR in DLG3 format.  There were 492 units in Virginia in this version.  Units were uniquely identified by a three character string and 
were sequentially coded downstream to upstream. As the first digital HU dataset for Virginia it was simply called the Virginia Hydrologic Unit layer.

				<procdesc>A 1995 permutation of the hydrologic units of Virginia were created for a number of reasons - greater possible accuracy, new HU delineation 
standards, new watershed projects, interstate coordination, and increased use of watershed geography by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ).
The NRCS, DCR, and DEQ decided in June of 1993 to revise Virginia's existing hydrologic unit system.  All linework was checked for accuracy, redelineated, 
and digitally recaptured by DCR where improvements could be made.  Some hydrologic units were merged, others divided, and still others significantly 
adjusted from their 1989 form.  Coordination with all nearby states resulted in the adjustment of many border units to create a greater continuance of linework 
from state to state.  The resulting 494 watersheds were then recoded upstream to downstream (opposite the 1989 order) as per new guidelines.  Unit coding 
continued to use a three character string as per the original version but their sequential order was appropriately reversed.  Textual descriptions of the units were 
revised and standardized. The units of this system are often referred to as the 14 digit hydrologic units, since that is how large the official sixth order unit 
numbering was at the time (but no longer).

				<procdesc>An initial form of the national Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) was developed by the VA DCR with assistance from the USDA-NRCS and the US EPA.
The goal was to comply with the new federal standards for the delineation of hydrologic unit boundaries.  The final product did not strictly follow the varying standards 
of the time so it is referred to as the Virginia NWBD.  This layer used the 1995 sixth level hydrologic unit system as its basis.  Where at all possible, VaNWBD units were 
delineated so as to preserve the delineation intentions of the previous HU product, which has been widely used by state and federal agencies.  This adherence to previous 
products was not part of the new standard.  Despite the aim to make the VaNWBD units be the same as, or subsets of, the 1995 sixth level units, a number of boundary changes 
were made to accomodate the smaller unit size requirement of the sixth level units of the VaNWBD as per the new standards.  While 14 digit hydrologic units of the 1995 
version that are of a size that is within the acceptable range of the NWBD sixth level units were usually maintained, almost all larger units were divided. The primary 
differences between the sixth level units of this version of the VaNWBD and the 14 digit units of the 1995 layer are the following improvements: (1) all linework was 
redigitized in a heads up manner which improved capture accuracy; (2) updated HU delineation standards were used that were supported by a consortium of federal agencies 
and not just the USDA; (3) the new sixth level units are much smaller in area, typically from 10,000 to 40,000 acres, whereas the previous HU layer units averaged just 
over 54,000 acres in size; (4) water side delineations of frontal units now go to the toeface of the shore, which varies from 10 feet deep in the Bays to 30 feet deep in 
the Atlantic Ocean. Delineations also proceeded out to the 3 nautical mile territorial limit in the Atlantic; (5) units became seamless bewteen states in both linework 
and numbering; 6) fifth level units (10 digits) were created from the sixth level units (12 digits). The 1995 version required 11 and 14 digits for the same fifth and 
sixth level references; (7) units were coded uniquely and by drainage basin beginning upstream and proceeding sequentially to each unit downstream.  The general order 
is main stem of the primary water feature followed by tributairy, with no fifth or sixth level unit flowing into a unit of a lower reference code; (8) other useful  
attributes were added, including unit type, unit modifiers, state codes, and linework source.

				<procdesc>Version 2 of the VaNWBD was created following 10 months of use of VaNWBDv1 after enough attribute coding errors were found in the initial release to 
warrant a revised, corrected version. No linework changes were made.  Most edits applied to the sixth level coding but a few applied to the fifth level coding.  Many
involved a continued effort to keep the VaNWBD seamless between the states.  Less than 0.4% of the 27,600+ developer-entered attributes required correction. A summary of
attribution changes made to create VaNWBDv2 exists in a spreadsheet at DCR's Hydrologic Unit Geography web page: http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/soil-and-water/hu.shtml.

				<procdesc>Version 3 of the VaNWBD was created following modifications to the North Carolina, West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania WBD products as well 
as irregularities found in the Virginia layer during tests by Laura Davenport (USDA) and Sarah Walton (USGS) in May 2008 while looking for seamless data issues.
Attribution issues similar to those found in these tests were edited as part of this update as well.  There was also three linework additions that created new 
polygons but not new units.  Attribution issues included the following: (1) HUC_12, HUC_10, and HU_12_DS renumbering due to renumberings in other states;
(2) unit names including "Headwaters" required the term before the feature name; (3) unit names could no longer include the term "Deep" (Atlantic, Chesapeake, and 
Potomac)but could now include the unit code # (feature-#); (4) a META_ID variable was added to the polygon records.  Initial values for the polygon and the arc 
entries for META_ID were VA01 but were changed to VA02 for those polygons with attribution changes in May 2007 (v2) and changed to VA03 for arcs modifed in 
VaNWBDv3 and for polygons with attribution changes in Sept/Oct 2008.  A summary of linework and attribution changes made to create VaNWBDv3 exists in a spreadsheet 
at DCR's Hydrologic Unit Geography web page: http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/soil-and-water/hu.shtml.

				<procdesc>Version 4 of the VaNWBD was needed following completion of the sixth level WBD units in the surrounding states.  Small boundary adjustments at state 
borders were made and a few attributes corrected, especially for the HU_LEVEL arc variable. Minor linework modifications created no new polygons or units. 
The META_ID variable was changed to VA04 for all polygons and arcs affected by attribution or geometry modifications.  A summary of linework and attribution changes 
made to create VaNWBDv4 exists in a spreadsheet at DCR's Hydrologic Unit Geography web page: http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/soil-and-water/hu.shtml.

				<procdesc>Version 5 of the VaNWBD was created to make a few linework and attribution corrections, to update rapidly changing shoreline linework, to reflect
an updated state boundary, to smooth the linework where it crossed the new state boundary, and to make the attribution changes neded to reflect the recent WBD model
schema update.  Schema modifications included the following line attribution changes: (1) HULevel was replaced by HUDigits, (2) HUMod codes were added and used a 
new code set; (3) META_ID was dropped but is maintained by Virginia in a seperate table; (4) non-standard linesource codes have been replaced by federal standard 
codes. Schema modifications included the following polygon attribution changes: (1) HUMod codes use a new code set and are seperated by a comma not a forward slash; 
(2) 10-digit references are dropped; (3) some attributes are renamed - HUC_12 now HUC12, HU_12_DS now ToHUC, HU_12_Name now Name, HU_12_Mod now HUMod, HU_12_Type 
now HUType; (4) META_ID was dropped but is maintained by Virginia in a seperate table.  In addition the following changes were made that are not related to standard 
changes: (1) calculated unit areas were not included for polygons except as the system automatically records them; (2) units which cross the Virginia state boundary 
are included in whole and not just that portion in Virginia; (3) cross-border units are divided at the state boundary for selection purposes with each portion identified 
as to the state it is in; (4) both the federal standards unit name and Virginia name for each unit are given. Attribution edits were predominatly made to reflect the 
new HUMod code set and to correct ToHUC errors found by a USGS review from 2013-2014.  A summary of linework and attribution changes made to create VaNWBDv5 exists

				<procdesc>Version 6 of the VaNWBD was created to make it compliant with the modifications found necessary by a national fifth and sixth level
unit name review by the USGS.  This review also requested a fifth level unit change that created two HUDigits changes, a HUC12 change, and several ToHUC changes. A summary

		<overview>
			<eaover>The delineated hydrologic units of this dataset are represented as closed polygons.  Boundaries are representative of ridge lines or,
where there is little topographic difference, the imagined line along which water on either side flows off into different streams or other bodies 
of water.  The polygons/units are coded with the official 12 digit codes as well as with custom shorthand codes that begins with a subbasin code.

Subbasin codes used in this layer are not part of the WBD standard but a Virginia feature.  There meanings are as follows:	  
AO - Atlantic Ocean Coastal
AS - Albemarle Sound Coastal
BS - Big Sandy River
CB - Cheasapeake Bay and Small Bay Coastal
CL - Chowan River, Lower
CM - Chowan River, Middle
CU - Chowan River, Upper
JA - James River-Appomattox River
JL - James River, Lower
JM - James River, Middle
JR - James River-Rivanna River
JU - James River, Upper
NE - New River
PL - Potomac River, Lower
PS - Potomac River-Shenandoah River
PU - Potomac River, Upper
RA - Rappahannock River
RD - Roanoke River-Dan River
RL - Roanoke River, Lower
RU - Roanoke River, Upper
TC - Tennessee River-Clinch River
TH - Tennessee River-Holston River
TP - Tennessee River-Powell River
YA - Yadkin River
YO - York River
